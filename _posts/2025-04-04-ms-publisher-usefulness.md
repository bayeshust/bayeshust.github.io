# Example Task: Creating Personalized Event Name Badges with Mail Merge
## Scenario
You're organizing a conference or workshop and need to print 100 personalized name badges, each with:
+ Attendee’s full name
+ Job title
+ Company name
+ QR code for check-in
+ Your event’s branding (logo, background)

## Why Microsoft Publisher Is Perfect for This
### Step-by-step Workflow
1. Prepare Your Data
	- Create an Excel spreadsheet:

| First Name | Last Name | Title       | Company        | QR Code Image Path         |
|------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Alice      | Chen      | Analyst     | FinCorp        | C:\QR\alice_qr.png         |
| Bob        | Smith     | Manager     | DataWorks      | C:\QR\bob_qr.png           |

2. Open Publisher & Choose Template
	- Go to File > New > Name Badges
	- Choose a template or start with a blank badge layout.

3. Insert Design Elements
	- Insert a logo, background color, or shapes for styling.
	- Add text placeholders for name, title, and company.
	- Use Insert > Picture Placeholder to mark where QR codes will go.

4. Start Mail Merge
	- Go to Mailings > Select Recipients > Use Existing List
	- Load your Excel file.
	- Insert merge fields like <<First Name>> <<Last Name>>, <<Title>>, etc.

5. Add Image Merge Field (QR Code)
	- Use Insert > Picture > Linked Picture and insert the <<QR Code Image Path>> field.

6. Preview & Finish
	- Use Mailings > Preview Results to see how each badge looks.
	- Click Finish & Merge > Print or Export to PDF for professional printing.

### 📌 Why Not Use Word?

1. Manual layouting is painful—text and images jump around.
2. No built-in image mail merge without scripting or workarounds.
3. Harder to precisely align multiple badges on one page.

### 📌 Why Not Use InDesign?

1. Requires scripting or third-party plugins for image-based mail merge.
2. Steeper learning curve, overkill for simple badge jobs.
3. No native Excel integration—would require converting to CSV or XML.
